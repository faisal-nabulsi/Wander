//  A tiny, app-wide connectivity flag backed by NWPathMonitor. Purely cosmetic: it lets the UI
//  show a subtle, non-nagging "Offline" hint so the app's calm empty states (a hidden weather
//  card, a globe that can't load, an empty raids board) read as intentional rather than broken.
//
//  It NEVER gates or blocks anything — teleport, joystick, and routes stay fully usable offline.
//  Nothing in the app should branch behaviour on this; it only drives an optional indicator.
